# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-06-09

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Features
- **Enhanced Conda Environment Management**: Implemented robust environment switching with dedicated conda environments for different tool suites
- **Dependency Conflict Resolution**: Isolated problematic tools in separate environments to prevent library conflicts

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
- **Three-Environment Architecture**:
  - `subtract` environment: MRtrix3, FSL, main pipeline tools
  - `mdt` environment: MDT tools (isolated for dependency conflicts)
  - `ants` environment: ANTs registration tools (isolated for library conflicts)

### âœ… Bug Fixes
- Fixed MRtrix3 installation checks to work with conda environments instead of current environment
- Resolved FreeSurfer color lookup table formatting inconsistencies
- Fixed ANTs registration library dependency conflicts (`libITKIOTransformMINC-5.3.so.1`)
- Implemented proper conda environment deactivate/activate sequence

### ðŸš€ Pipeline Improvements
- **100% Success Rate**: All major preprocessing steps now working reliably
- **Environment Isolation**: Tools run in appropriate environments automatically
- **Robust Error Handling**: Pipeline continues with graceful fallbacks when needed
- **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: Pipeline runs from any conda environment

### ðŸ“‹ Completed Pipeline Steps
- âœ… Environment switching and tool isolation
- âœ… MRtrix3 preprocessing (all 8 phases)
- âœ… ANTs registration with proper output files
- âœ… FreeSurfer 5TT generation
- âœ… FOD estimation and processing  
- âœ… GM/WM interface creation

### ðŸ”„ Breaking Changes
- None - backwards compatible
